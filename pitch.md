# Great Wall Pitch

The problem of [physical robbery of crypto assets aka wrench attack](https://xkcd.com/538/) is increasing in frequency and severity. Look no further than [@lopp](https://x.com/lopp) on Twitter, CSO of [the leading company in the sector](https://casa.io/). There, you'll find:

1 Daily tweets about cases of wrench attacks or hints on how to prevent it;

2 [Comments on how he is personally uneasy about this situation](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7309197170404937728/);

3 [Solutions that are either costly or require shared custody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsfR6ZIkzPs&t=2734s);

From those, we can conclude there are no affordable satisfactory solutions for coercion resistance that are also deviceless, individual and non-obscure. Yet!

Meet [Great Wall](https://linktr.ee/greatwallt3): a key derivation scheme. Unlike conventional alternatives as [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), it also takes [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) as input. Coercion-resistance happens not because of geographic separation between you and your keys, nor because you use a [trick that (hopefully) your adversary (still) hasn't learned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs's_principle), but because transferring knowledge to them is impossible by design before a predefined loading time passes.

Monetization happens by recurring micro payments by the user to outsource the burden of doing the aforementioned loading. Advanced cryptographic techniques allow that to happen without loss of security properties.
